## ü§ñ Automated Trading - The Game Changer

### What is Automated Trading?

Imagine having a trading assistant that works 24/7, monitoring your positions and making smart decisions based on your rules. That's exactly what we've built!

### Stop Loss with Profit Taking

**What it does:** Automatically protects your profits and limits your losses.

**Real-world example:** You buy Bitcoin at $50,000 and set a 5% stop loss. If Bitcoin drops to $47,500, it automatically sells to protect your money. If it rises to $55,000, it sells to lock in your 10% profit.

```bash
# Set up automatic protection for your Bitcoin
python main.py stop-loss-strategy BTC --stop-loss 5.0 --profit-target 15.0

# What this means:
# - If price drops 5% from your entry, it sells (stop loss)
# - If price rises 15% from your entry, it sells (profit taking)
# - Uses $100 by default for the position
```

**Customize it:**
```bash
# More conservative: 3% stop loss, 20% profit target, $200 position
python main.py stop-loss-strategy ETH --stop-loss 3.0 --profit-target 20.0 --position-size 200

# More aggressive: 10% stop loss, 8% profit target, $50 position
python main.py stop-loss-strategy DOGE --stop-loss 10.0 --profit-target 8.0 --position-size 50
```

### Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)

**What it does:** Buys the same amount regularly, regardless of price. This is one of the smartest ways to invest in crypto!

**Why it works:** When prices are high, you buy fewer coins. When prices are low, you buy more coins. Over time, this averages out to a good price.

```bash
# Buy $50 worth of Bitcoin every 7 days
python main.py dca-strategy BTC --amount 50 --frequency 7

# What this means:
# - Every 7 days, automatically buy $50 worth of Bitcoin
# - No matter if Bitcoin is $40,000 or $60,000
# - Stops after 12 purchases (about 3 months)
```

**Customize your DCA:**
```bash
# More frequent, smaller amounts
python main.py dca-strategy ETH --amount 25 --frequency 3 --max-purchases 24

# Less frequent, larger amounts
python main.py dca-strategy BTC --amount 100 --frequency 14 --max-purchases 6
```

### Starting Your Automated Trading

Once you've set up your strategies, start the automated trading bot:

```bash
# Start all your configured strategies
python main.py auto-trade
```

**What happens:**
- The bot starts monitoring your positions
- It checks prices every minute
- When conditions are met, it automatically places trades
- You can stop it anytime with Ctrl+C

**Pro tip:** Start with small amounts to test the system before scaling up!

## üìä Smart Portfolio Analysis

### Portfolio Performance - Know Your Winners and Losers

Ever wondered which of your crypto investments are doing well and which ones are dragging you down? Now you can see it at a glance!

```bash
# See your best and worst performing cryptos
python main.py portfolio-performance
```

**What you'll see:**
- üèÜ **Top 3 performers** - Your best investments
- üìâ **Bottom 3 performers** - Areas that might need attention
- üìà **Performance percentages** - How much each crypto has gained or lost

### Quick Buying Power Check

Before placing a trade, quickly check how much money you have available:

```bash
# Check your available funds
python main.py buying-power
```

**Smart validation:** The system now checks your buying power before placing orders, so you won't get those annoying "insufficient funds" errors anymore!

---

## üîç Advanced Order Management

### Find Exactly What You're Looking For

The new order management system is like having a super-powered search for your trading history.

**View all your orders:**
```bash
python main.py orders
```

**Find specific orders:**
```bash
# Only open orders
python main.py orders --state open

# Only buy orders for Bitcoin
python main.py orders --symbol BTC-USD --side buy

# Only filled orders (completed trades)
python main.py orders --state filled

# Only market orders
python main.py orders --type market

# Combine filters - open buy orders for Bitcoin
python main.py orders --symbol BTC-USD --state open --side buy

# Limit results to 5 orders
python main.py orders --limit 5
```

### Cancel Orders Like a Pro

Found an order you want to cancel? No problem!

```bash
# Cancel an order by its ID
python main.py cancel 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012
```

**How to find order IDs:**
1. Run `python main.py orders --state open`
2. Copy the ID from the first column
3. Use that ID with the cancel command

---

## üîç Discover Trading Pairs

### See What's Available to Trade

Not sure what cryptos you can trade? Now you can explore all available options:

```bash
# See all available trading pairs
python main.py trading-pairs

# Check specific pairs
python main.py trading-pairs BTC-USD ETH-USD DOGE-USD
```

**What you'll see:**
- üìä **Symbol** - The trading pair (like BTC-USD)
- ‚úÖ **Status** - Whether it's active for trading
- üîç **Easy discovery** - Find new cryptos to explore

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Smart Validation & Error Prevention

### No More Surprises!

We've made the system much smarter about preventing errors:

**Before placing a buy order:**
- ‚úÖ Checks your buying power
- ‚úÖ Validates the symbol exists
- ‚úÖ Ensures the amount is reasonable
- ‚úÖ Provides helpful error messages

**Example of smart error handling:**
```bash
# If you try to buy more than you can afford
python main.py buy BTC 10000

# You'll get a helpful message like:
# ‚ùå Insufficient buying power. You have $500 available.
# üí° Try a smaller amount or check your buying power with:
#    python main.py buying-power
```

### Better Symbol Handling

The system now automatically handles symbol formatting:

```bash
# These all work the same way:
python main.py prices BTC
python main.py prices BTC-USD
python main.py buy ETH 50
python main.py buy ETH-USD 50
```

## üö® Important Safety Information

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Automated Trading Risks

**Before using automated trading, understand these risks:**

- **Real Money**: Automated strategies trade with real funds
- **Market Risk**: Crypto prices are highly volatile
- **Technical Risk**: Internet issues or API failures can affect trading
- **Strategy Risk**: No strategy guarantees profits; losses are possible
- **24/7 Markets**: Crypto trades 24/7, strategies may execute at any time

### üõ°Ô∏è Safety Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Begin with $10-50 trades to test the system
2. **Monitor Closely**: Check your orders and portfolio regularly
3. **Use Stop Losses**: Always have protection against large losses
4. **Don't Overinvest**: Only trade what you can afford to lose
5. **Test First**: Use small amounts to verify everything works

### üéØ Recommended Testing Sequence

```bash
# 1. Test basic functionality
python main.py portfolio
python main.py prices BTC ETH

# 2. Test order management
python main.py orders
python main.py orders --state open

# 3. Test small buy order (if you have funds)
python main.py buy BTC 5

# 4. Test portfolio performance
python main.py portfolio-performance

# 5. Set up automated strategy with small amounts
python main.py stop-loss-strategy BTC --stop-loss 5.0 --profit-target 10.0 --position-size 10

# 6. Test automated trading briefly
python main.py auto-trade
# (Press Ctrl+C after a few minutes to stop)
```
