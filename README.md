## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Getting Your Robinhood API Credentials

1. **Enable API access** in your Robinhood account settings
2. **Generate API key and private key** from Robinhood developer portal
3. **Keep them secure** - never share or commit to version control

### Create Your .env File

Create a `.env` file in the project folder with your credentials:

```bash
# Create .env file
touch .env
```

Add your credentials to the `.env` file:
```
API_KEY=your_api_key_here
BASE64_PRIVATE_KEY=your_base64_encoded_private_key_here
ROBINHOOD_API_BASE_URL=https://trading.robinhood.com
```

> **üîí Security Note:** Never share your `.env` file or commit it to version control. It's already in `.gitignore` for safety.

### üö® Automated Trading Risks

**Before using automated trading, understand these risks:**

- **Real Money**: Automated strategies trade with real funds
- **Market Risk**: Crypto prices are highly volatile
- **Technical Risk**: Internet issues, API failures, or bugs can affect trading
- **Strategy Risk**: No strategy guarantees profits; losses are possible
- **24/7 Markets**: Crypto trades 24/7, strategies may execute at any time

**Best Practices:**
- Start with small amounts ($10-50)
- Test strategies thoroughly before scaling up
- Monitor automated trading regularly
- Have stop-losses in place
- Don't invest more than you can afford to lose

Example API usage:
```python
from src.api.robinhood_client import RobinhoodClient

client = RobinhoodClient()
client.authenticate()

# Place a limit buy order
client.place_limit_order("BTC-USD", "buy", "0.001", "50000")

# Place a stop loss order
client.place_stop_loss_order("BTC-USD", "sell", "0.001", "45000")
```

## üö® Troubleshooting & Common Issues

### Quick Fixes

**‚ùå Authentication failed?**
```bash
# Check your .env file exists and has correct format
cat .env

# Verify your credentials are correct
python main.py --debug portfolio
```

**‚ùå Command not found?**
```bash
# Make sure you're in the right folder
pwd
ls -la

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

**‚ùå "asset_quantity must be specified" error?**
- ‚úÖ **Fixed!** This was a bug in market buy orders that has been resolved
- The app now automatically calculates asset quantity from USD amount

**‚ùå "must have at most 18 decimal places" error?**
- ‚úÖ **Fixed!** Asset quantities are now properly rounded to 8 decimal places
- This prevents Robinhood's decimal place limit errors

**‚ùå No holdings found?**
- Make sure your Robinhood account has crypto trading enabled
- You need existing holdings to test sell orders

**‚ùå Order cancellation failed?**
- Verify the order ID is correct and the order is still open
- Use `python main.py orders --state open` to see current open orders

**‚ùå "Insufficient buying power" error?**
- Check your current buying power: `python main.py buying-power`
- Try a smaller amount that fits within your available funds
- The app now validates buying power before placing orders

### Getting Help

1. **Check the logs** with debug mode:
   ```bash
   python main.py --debug portfolio
   ```

2. **Verify your setup**:
   ```bash
   python main.py --help
   ```

3. **Test with small amounts** first:
   ```bash
   python main.py buy BTC 5
   ```
